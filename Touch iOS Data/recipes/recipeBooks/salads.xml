         <excerpt>Salad for the Start of June</excerpt>
         <description><![CDATA[<p>Scale the amounts listed here up or down, depending on how many people are joining you for the meal. This amount should satisfy six people as a side, start or finish to a lovely meal.</p>

<p>one head red butter lettuce washed, dried and carefully torn into pleasant-sized pieces<br />
half as much mizuna treated as butter lettuce above<br />
two cupped handfuls of miner's lettuce, washed and dried<br />
twelve mint leaves, chopped<br />
greens of 1-2 spring onions, sliced rather thinly<br />
about half of one small fennel bulb also sliced thinly, best with a mandoline<br />
eight small red radishes, sliced<br />
chive blossoms (broken apart) and/or sage flowers (or any small, edible purple flower)</p>

<p>Add the vegetables to your large salad bowl (set the flowers aside). Then, prepare the dressing below:</p>

<p>one clove garlic, minced<br />
heaping tbsp good dijon mustard<br />
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar<br />
8 tbsp toasted walnut oil<br />
1/2 tsp sea salt<br />
fresh ground pepper to taste</p>

<p>Add dressing ingredients to a blender, blend until smooth and well emulsified. Starting with a small amount, toss with the salad greens, dressing to your preference. You will have some dressing for tomorrow, as this recipe makes plenty. Finally, sprinkle the flowers on top.</p>]]></description>
