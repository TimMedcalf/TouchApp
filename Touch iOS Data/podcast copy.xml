			<description><![CDATA[Sifting through his archive of live recordings, Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek) chose this performance from 2015 (in a very cold church in Bochum, 
			Germany) as a favourite. As with most of his gigs, the concert was improvised, using an analogue tone generator as the main sound source, a radio, a contact mic, and a 
			selection of pedals. Always a hit-and-miss venture, but always exciting (though at times nerve-wracking for the artist).

			<description><![CDATA[Whilst on holiday in Sicily Stuart wanted to capture the sound of the local church bells. Choosing to record at 12 noon every day seemed a reasonable way 
			to record more elaborate bell combinations whilst also fitting in other holiday plans with his travelling companion.

An edit of ten minutes from each location is included here, with 12 o’clock being positioned in the middle at five minutes to afford some context of the local area. Sicilian dialect 
has been used to indicate each day. Church names have been used to indicate location rather than street names, and bells 
from nearby churches can also be heard as the timing on each church is slightly different. Some churches ring twice, and one church not at all. The bird sounds were made by an old 
man hiding behind the tree that I was recording under.

Recorded using a Sound Devices Mix-Pre 6, and a stereo pair of LOM Usi omni-directional mics attached to a coat hanger.

Màrtiri – San Francesco di Paola, Palermo
Mèrcuri – Cattedrale di Palermo and Parrocchia Ss Maria Assunta
Iòviri – Parrochia San Girolamo, Mondello
Vènniri – Chiesa di San Domenico, Palermo
Sàbatu – Cattedrale di Monreale

			<description><![CDATA[Estonia has a rich and powerful nature orchestra, and this might be because two thirds of the country is covered with forests and bogs which are often almost untouched. Estonian nature sound is sometimes discrete and quiet, sometimes powerful, but it is always magical.

This sound piece features the magnificent performance of the orchestra over a period of 24 hours in the spring. The recording opens with a dawn chorus in the Alam Pedja nature reserve. It then travels to the primaeval forest of Jarvselja and the wetlands south of the Ahja jogi, close to Lake Peipsi and the Russian border. The latter is a boreonemoral, drained peatland and swamp forest area.

Chirping birds, croaking frogs, a barking deer and a rumbling thunderstorm make up the choir. The star performers, howling wolves, end this nature symphony just before the sun rises over the forest.

Great care has been taken to make the sound piece time and rhythm coherent as well as biogeographically consistent. Man-made noise such as woodworking has been kept as it is, an integral part of the soundscape. The intention is to render the reality as is, not to change it: quiet sounds have remained quiet and might require more concentrated listening on the part of the listener.

The music of nature moves slowly. The recorded piece invites the listener to an immersive experience. Take the time to listen through the full length and hopefully be transported.

Our thanks go to Robert Oetjen and Triin Libe of the Palupohja nature school, to Andrus Kannel as well as to Mariell Jussi and Rene Valner who have helped make these recordings possible.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This recording is made off the back balcony of the Cube Gallery in the village of Moira at around 8:15pm on March 17 (St. Patrick’s Day), 2018.

The balcony looked out onto an area of open land, with a Hindu temple on one side and an old Portuguese-style cathedral on the other. I am struck by the merging of layers of sound in this scene — birds and insects, but also sometimes traffic (though the road is distant), voices, power tools and non-power tools, dogs, and various unknown activities. In the middle of the recording, an unseen train passes and somehow overtakes everything for a moment. There are sounds I cannot identify no matter how hard I listen to them.

This piece is composed by all the forces that had assembled themselves in that place at that time, on the edge of night.

Many thanks to Satinder Singh and Eric Patrick for making this recording possible.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA["You really should hear the frogs," suggested our hosts. They had taken us to their country house on a warm evening in May 2017, situated beside Little River, Beaverdam, Virginia.

Late that evening, we were led down the lawn, through the darkness towards the river nearby, a few hundred yards from the house. As we neared the water, we began to hear calls from a large scattered array of frogs, littering the shallows of the near and far banks of the river. Two main species were present; the Green Frog (Lithobates clamitans) was the most common, its twangy call sometimes compared to a loose banjo string. This call is often repeated a few times, each decreasing in volume. The other call, a more sporadic, slightly comedic deep tenor is from the American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus).

Naturally, I wanted to get a recording. Problematically, my sound equipment had been left in Durham, North Carolina, two hundred miles away. I was over from the UK working on a documentary in NC and I only had a phone without additional mics, so had to make do.

The next day, listening back to the functional recording I’d made on my phone was deeply underwhelming. I decided that I really needed to drive back to Durham, get my sound kit and return to Little River and have another go the following night.

This recording was made with a spaced pair of DPA 4018s into a Zaxcom Nomad.

			<description><![CDATA[It was 1995; a cold fall day with heavy fog just north of the San Francisco Bay between the Bay Bridge and Jenner in Northern California. I had a spaced pair of B&K 4003 omni-directional microphones with me to capture bay backgrounds. Due to the fog I was able to capture a variety of horns throughout the day.

The piece is a collage of these horn backgrounds along with a freight container ship horn from the Port of Los Angeles. The discovery of hearing these together was a happenstance while previewing the files in unison and hearing a suspended chord automatically I perceived it as a composition.

I also added an underwater sound recorded with a B&amp;K 8011 hydrophone of jet streams from a pool filter.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA["tic-tac-toe" was written for Gilbert Ratcliffe, who in 2017 was a final-year dance student at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire. For this performance, called "You Watching Me?", choreographed for a small group of dancers, Gil wrote:

"My research was centred on the physical and mental manifestation of my journey with Tourettes Syndrome. I explored it through the collaborative process between choreographer and dancers to see if we could create a non-narrative, abstract dance work that was able to elicit an emotional, performative response." Gil knew what the broad structure needed to be, and the dancers had ideas about sounds that would resonate well with the subject  but there was lots of freedom between those staging posts. I loved how the dancers only needed occassional markers, between which they related to the sounds but werent bound by them. No need for anything as prosaic as counting out beats.
Gil's research involved talking to lots of people with TS, and reading through it I got keen on the simple idea of the electrical impulses that run through the body as it moves  whether voluntarily or involuntarily. In the end, its all a synaptic dance. I recorded the feet of the dancers as they rehearsed, so that the piece could conjour up unseen dancers around the stage. Elsewhere metal spins against metal, balls bounce to a stop, there is a visit to the sea shore and a recording I made of the old editor of the Guardian being "banged out", in the tradition of old Fleet Street. The painting is courtesy of Gil's mum Melanie  an artist and painter who has often worked with dancers.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This is a two channel recording of a live solo performance using the Moog guitar plus stuff. The set was improvised and only the second time Id performed solo with the Moog (the first being the night before in Swansea). The gig was at the Brunswick Club in Bristol which houses several arts groups including BEEF (Bristol Experimental Expanded Film) who, via sound and video artist Kathy Hinde, had invited me to perform. When I arrived in Bristol and gave the taxi driver the address, he told me that the Brunswick Club was closed down, and even if it wasnt, he doubted Id be performing there. Apparently it used to be a Working Man's Club frequented by taxi drivers. Not any more.

Equipment: Moog Guitar, ebow, shortwave radio, tone generator, guitar pedals (reverb, delay, distortion and fuzz factory), plasma and bicycle lights, a childs light wand, two vibrators, portable CD player (unplugged), modified fans, mixer, and miscelaneous debris.

1. Geneva Skeen - Pop Song 16:48
2. Sarah Rara - Separating the Air 20:12.

For the closing of Yann Novaks exhibition Repose,Novak invited Geneva Skeen and Sarah Rara to perform inside/alongside his installation. Each artist's performance was accompanied by the sound of Novaks installation demonstrated here via a room-recording from the event.

Skeens Pop Song is a temporal response to Novaks drone work, and a cultural response to our times. In harmonizing with Novaks loop - divided into 3-4 minute segments (the average acceptable length of a pop song) - SkeensPop Song acknowledges that populist times call for populist measures, but refuses populist comfort, acceptance, and pale standards of beauty as means of resistance.

Raras Separating the Air games of listening and learning between voice and computer at the boundary between music and speech. Each part is a device to punctuate silence, divide time, move the air.

			<description><![CDATA[Victorian acoustician Herman Helmholtz studied sound and sensation in the 1800s; through his research he developed the Helmholtz Resonator, this object, usually made from glass or brass, is tuned to a specific resonant frequency and used to demonstrate the principle of acoustic resonance. Helmholtz writes about using these tuned devices to listen to sustained pitches from musical instruments. He also accounts hearing waterfalls, the howling wind and horse drawn carriages through his handheld resonators, using these devices to extract tones from the environmental sounds around him.

Inspired by the work of Helmholtz, this piece incorporates both tuned and un-tuned vessels to explore resonant sound objects. Using two large glass carboys (designed as liquid transportation vessels) partially filled with rainwater, alongside two smaller Helmholtz Resonators, Surrounding Air comprises extended recordings of these acoustic objects. Each vessel contains its own unique sound space, a distinct resonating signature quietly bellowing and heard only at the point at which it meets the outside world.

Placing small omnidirectional microphones and hydrophones inside the glass reveals a unique perspective on this space. Recording a rainstorm through the vessels we hear a complex and ever-changing sound world from this fixed listening point. After capturing the sonic signature of the vessels I built a semi-generative synthesis engine in tune with the containers, moving towards a musical world tempered to these glass vessels, extracting tones from the surrounding environment in honour of Helmholtz. Listening through these objects allows us to hear the world as he may have done over 150 years earlier.

			<description><![CDATA[Ever the archivist at heart, my father, Francisco Alvelos, had the foresight of recording the national radio and television broadcasts of the Portuguese "Carnation" Revolution as it unfolded on the 25th of April, 1974. Just audio, that is: home video was still years away, as was colour TV I was then seven years old, and remember an afternoon without school, the radio hosting strange voices, a still image on the TV set. By dinner time TV broadcast had been restored and some very serious-looking men in strange garments made very serious speeches, my parents expressions of expectancy and excitement an obvious indicator that, despite being beyond my comprehension, something major was taking place. That somehow made up for the disappointing disappearance of cartoons... The World was different back then for a seven-year-old under an ailing European dictatorship.

By chance I recently unearthed the cassette tape my father recorded, and took great care in digitising it as it might not survive one last playback. It did snap once, but I managed to successfully improvise a bit of tape surgery

Here, then, are the newsflashes and the first public address of the Revolution Council to the nation: I edited out the obvious copyrighted material, and kept the marching anthems to a sensible degree. At 20 50 on this edit, we hear a declaration summarising the motives for the military upsurge; remarkable how a significant part of what is said still resonates in 2016 - and how timely that I found this recording on the eve of the Portuguese presidential election. The last 30 seconds of this edit, the tail-end of the junta declaration and the ensuing silence, are eerie in their prescience: What now?, the fumbling silence seems to wonder. It still does.

Listening while digitising, the recordings brought vivid memories of my father. And somehow I felt I was fulfilling his wish, rendered audible almost 42 years later: to preserve and convey a historical document for future generations to remember, reflect and interpret.

			<description><![CDATA[If ever there was a reason for 333 to break its own rules, this is it: the 33rd anniversary of the very first Touch release.

So we skip our proverbial anonymous random modus operandi just this once. We even managed to produce proper liner notes to a 3-track extravaganza. And just this once, we -are- naming our sources.

This special edition of Touch Radio is a quasi-random mash-up of prior editions: 3, 24, and 33, finely sliced into 3 hit singles in the making, each a good 3 minutes and 33 seconds in length (this one rule is unbreakable).

			<description><![CDATA["In Spring 2013 I was part of an ornithological survey (bird migration census) in a desert area in the Nile Valley, Egypt. Our team lived, considering local conditions, in a rather modern building in a town called Sandafa Al Far.

Apart from the actual work, our standardised observations, I most of the time made sound recordings of birds, amphibians, insects and the general soundscape in the vicinity of our house. Sometimes guarded by two policemen (because of an allegedly unsafe situation after the so-called Arab Spring) but always accompanied by a cluster of curious and noisy children.

The combination of an extreme climate, a precarious political situation, witnessing violence, experiencing severe health problems and not least being surrounded by an omnipresent, diverse and sometimes almost too powerful soundscape led to a somewhat surreal memory of my time there."

			<description><![CDATA[To call this field recording would be crediting the situation with more adventure than it deserves. At five in the morning, with a hangover starting to percolate, the ideal conditions are surely to just roll over, hit record and go back to sleep  and that is pretty much what happened here. End of disclaimer.

Boats, whether out at sea or in harbour, have a particular vocabulary of sounds. On the water, they are masked by the white noise of the ocean, in which  as many sailors have reported  you can hear almost any sound imaginable. Moored up, where things are quieter, the water laps and slaps the hull while the wind plays aeolian harp on the mast.

That rigging sound is often a chorus of tapping lines against masts, but this particular boat  a cruising yacht with a Bermuda rig, moored at Yarmouth after a days sailing  had an unusually musical voice, sounding clear notes as the wind passed through its structure. At sea this was a contented hum, but at night it felt much more ominous.

The tones in this piece were recorded in one of the sleeping cabins in the stern, a little resonant box. Of course, there has been some processing  mainly to remove the snoring of sailors.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The word gibbet is used both to refer to an executional structure and to a hanging iron cage that used to display the remains of executed prisoners; when someone is thusly displayed, it is known as gibbeting. 

Recording the wooden gibbet in 2012, believed to be haunted burial site and located at Caxton in Cambridgeshire, to capture the sound of the gallows wood (elm) and saproxylic (dead wood) invertebrates (beetles) that lived within it was a challenge because of the vast amount of traffic that passes by. It is located beside a busy roundabout (A428 to Cambridge) and I initially found it difficult to capture the wooden gibbet creaking and moving in the way I had envisaged. I therefore used contact microphones to get inside the construction. I was inspired by the grim history of this location, the place of multiple murders and capital punishment, and also from reading about Bernie Krause (b.1938) who, on the CD included in his wonderful book Wild Soundscapes, explains that "recordings are an illusion the best microphone systems and recorders cannot possibly reproduce exactly what our ears hear in the holophonic way that we hear it." (2002) He documented acoustic environments that faced dramatic change or extinction but often needed to recreate the sounds of nature by double tracking or changing microphone placement. 

This location has changed dramatically recently as a McDonalds fast food restaurant opened a restaurant on this site recently.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA["Inspired by BJ Nilsen's performance at LACE in Los Angeles last month, I decided to attempt my own composition using field recordings. The source recordings are quite crude in comparison to those made by the great Mr Nilsen; I even used only an iPhone to collect the recordings; but after a little judicious use of processing back at the studio, I am pleased with the results. On leaving LACE after the show, I noticed how many homeless were sleeping in the doorways at the back of the venue, where my car was parked. There were several droning air-conditioners, some emitting quite rhythmic sounds. It occurred to me that there are many that would hear this as music (myself included) but it's very doubtful that those sleeping in those doorways do... or perhaps some do find some comfort or music in such sounds. I assembled several of them to create this, an anthem for the homeless."

Recording by Heitor Alvelos on Bruce Geduldig and Bernadette Martou's balcony, Porto, Portugal. The vantage point, overlooking the tail end of the Douro river from a considerable height, allows the acoustic experience to become as impressive as the visual: the sound of the fireworks travels back and forth through the valley in considerable detail. 

Recent trends in mass entertainment have dictated the expectation for further ingredients of sensory input, i.e. the "pure" experience of the explosives shall not be enough. Cue the arrival of pop anthems as an added sound layer that, as far as acoustics go, can only be experienced as a distraction. This is the main reason for the dramatic pitch shift in the present recording: the sound fabric is brought down to the point where pop pap no longer hurts. In the meantime, a different landscape emerges, austere and foreboding.
 
Edited by Heitor Alvelos in Sues, August 2014: the recording has been left unaltered save for a pitch shift of -77%.

Sound has been integral in the relationship of the machines and their operators; used as a primary diagnostic tool, the sound of various operating components reveal the machines state of well being. Operators listened to the song of their engines, gaining insight in to particular problems, and clues to required maintenance.

Using accelerometers fixed to the steelwork of the engines, we could extract this world of sound; escaping steam, muscular pistons, popping and crackling valves  rhythmic and stuttering, sensitive and forthright the man made qualities of the engineering being exposed in the recordings.

Track 01. Mill Engine: A series of recordings of various parts of the engine.
Track 02. Difference Engine: A complete recording of a calculation cycle, this one being the polynomial equation; 
Y= 41+ 4X + 7X2 + X3 + 5X4 + 9X5 + 2X6 + 8X7

All recordings are exclusive.

Audialsense would like to thank Aleksander Kolkowski and the conservators of the Science Museum.

The performance highlighted this unique space through a gesture-less performance of sound and light. The piece is comprised of a purely synthesized sound devoid of traditional compositional elements and was accompanied by 180 projections of pure color.

Repose is presented here in a longer form to take advantage of the digital format.

'Grandmothers' Lounge - From the Other Side of Voices' is a joint work of radio producer Sang-il Choi (KR) and sound artist Jiyeon Kim (KR), commissioned by SeMa Biennale MediaCity Seoul 2014. Largely based on Sang-il Choi's anthropological audio recordings of folksongs and stories of grandmothers from South Korea, Jiyeon Kim made this sound installation adopting 3 directional speakers. This mix is especially prepared for TouchRadio. 

birds without mouths 00:00~06:17

Grandmothers who had lived in mountain villages used to play with imitating bird's call. Songs about birds and imitative sounds of birds call were passed on orally. For the people who lived in mountainous areas, birds were believed to be the reincarnation of the dead, who had oppression and resentment during their lives. Most of the words and lyrics concern listening to one's sorrows and comforting one's soul. You can hear calls of the lark, owl, cuckoo, wood pigeon, pheasant, nightingale, etc mimicked by grandmothers from different mountain villages with rustling leaves and folksong on birds.  

prayers 06:19~10:58

A mix of grandmothers' confessions during the act of praying with songs used in exorcism rituals. Sounds of metal resonance, water flow and feedback were added to accentuate an aspect of their lives - a shaman in their own families. 

unfinished chorus 10:59~15:07

This mix starts with one of the old ladies saying, "I can't even sing." As song is assumed as a centralised and capitalised epic, marginal unsong elements are often neglected and erased. With chopped sounds and refrains from mainly labour folksongs, I focused on 'unsung elements' (breaths, humming, laughter, shouts, etc.) to be extended into another kind of song. Grandmothers' chorus would not be finished until they stop breathing.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[In Spring 2009, I find myself by chance just a few hours by boat from Japans last frontier, the island of Iriomote, but I had no way to get there. Not enough time. Total frustration. The southern most island of Japan is 90% covered with rainforest and mangrove and home to many local species including not only insects, frogs and birds, but also Ryukyu flying foxes and the famous cat-leopard called Yamaneko, which was only discovered in 1965.

I make a promise to myself to return, even for short time, but with my recording equipment.

Finally this year it was possible. I went back this Summer with the help of the Tropical Biosphere Research Center University of the Ryukyus and the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris, I spent a week on the island recording with a four channel microphone setup. Sadly I didnt have the chance to see the neko this time

Unmastered field recording featuring amongst others: Elegant scops owl, Ryukyu flying fox, Yaeyama harpist frog, Ryukyu ruddy kingfisher, cicadas, Ryukyu green pigeon, Ryukyu crow, white breasted waterhen

			<description><![CDATA[Since technical evolution tends to unfold rapidly, human beings have not been able to evolve a (forewarning) sense of new forms of technology (for instance to detect radioactivity). Electronic emissions are also not sensually detectable. No one knows exactly how the technology of wireless transmitting devices affects humans. Radio, television, radiotelephones, mobile phones, GPS, computers, bluetooth and WiFi routers flood every place on earth with countless electronic waves.

Recordings of a standard WiFi router serve as the basis for the Fritz Kiste. Actually one cant really speak of (audio) recordings since the electronic waves of the WiFi are soundless. Their energy triggers the sensitive microphones, since these have been placed directly at the remote transmitting antenna. The recording - made with a D-40 Tascam, equipped with one microphone for each antenna - tapes the different transmission signals on the right or on the left channel as a stereo signal.

The WiFi router transmits at 3.4 MHz and so generates 3.4 billion cycles per second. The actual reception of the signals - eg. recorded during the transmission of an email with an image attachment - are only a few seconds long, but are prolonged through ever deeper analysis. The fragmentation was achieved via different processes, digital and analog, and via 'deceleration'. Thus fragments of a second were distended to minutes in length. In this way the router's timing-in-seconds, much too fast for human perception, becomes open to scrutiny.

The results are partly 'technoid' by which sounds are very much dependent on the timing. Sounds emerge at a high transmission activity; send-pauses sound more 'ambient'...]]></description>

The remote Snaefellsness Peninsula in Iceland is home to the tallest structure in Western Europe. A transmitter built originally in 1963 as a long-range, low-frequency (LORAN-C) navigation system and now used for longwave public radio purposes.

During a recent sound recording trip to Iceland, i was fortunate enough to gain access to the transmitter facility and able to take a series of field recordings, using an array of contact microphones attached to the mast and supporting guy wires.

Several of these recordings were particularly arresting, capturing the structure as it radiated a myriad of constantly shifting harmonic progressions, in response to the hot Icelandic summer sun and strong icy winds blowing in from the nearby Snaefellsjkull glacier. These two extremes combined caused rapid expansions and contractions in the 200-700metre steel support wires and core mast, to produce a spiralling, ever-changing, kaleidoscopic drone.

Of particular note as well, during a quiet point in the recording, my microphones started to pick up the audio of the longwave radio transmission. A graceful violin solo for 3 minutes, before the sun broke through the clouds and caused the structural resonance of the mast to increase once more, drowning out the radio with a music of the structure's own making.

Particularly beautiful is the notion that there is an ever-changing and constantly-in-flux sound emanating from this structure; an unbroken music, in direct response to its environment, which has been playing in constant form for the last 50 years. The sounds captured here represent a snapshot in time taken on the 15th June 2013, the specifics of which have never been, and will never be, repeated.

JRF C-series contact mics | Sound Devices 702 | Marantz PMD 661

Equipment used: 4 x Reson 4042 Hydrophones, rigged for MS recording, post-processed using Max/MSP; Nagra VI recorder.

Location: Placencia Bay, Belize.

Date: 13th December 2012.

Narrative:

After a long day of finicky experimentation in the sun, I returned to the bay to wash salt water from the equipment and to hose down. From 1630'37"N, 8822'1"W I looked out on a tranquil evening scene and decided to attempt one last recording. 

I had recorded throughout the day in shallow coral seas off the coast of Belize. I'd attempted to capture a spatial impression of the clouds of clicks and pops produced by crustacea and who-knows-what; a sound present at almost every ocean location on Earth. 

In the evening bay one boat was at anchor, a jet ski idled around and I saw a couple of tiny and distant fishing boats. Yet the underwater acoustic landscape was dense, quite different from the gentle evening scene that played out above the water.  

I assembled this sequence of recordings to share my experiences of these two places. The recordings made among the shallow reefs are filled with crustacea sounds punctuated by communication calls between toadfish and an occasional dolphin. 

Other impressions of this remote environment came to light when I auditioned the recordings back in the studio. The hydrophone rig became a barometer for other encounters. The tiniest brushings with what appeared to be fluffy fingers of soft coral revealed their harsh surface, rasping and gritty. As the evening currents shifted and strengthened "strumming" hydrophone cables conveyed the power of the underwater gales. 

Many thanks to Francesca von Habsburg and the T-B A21 Academy for the opportunity to record in these places.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Equipment Used:
Pearl MS-2 CL microphone outputting MS, matrixed in a Sound Devices SD302 mixer and recorded stereo to a Nagra BB+.

Location:
Camp Forktail Creek just outside the Corbett Tiger Reserve near Ramnagar, Uttaranchal, Northern India.

Date:
March/April 2009. [On a Wildeye trip to India with Chris Watson.]

Narrative:
After our evening meal of vegetable curry which followed a long, bumpy day in the Corbett Tiger Reserve (looking for... tigers of course!), we settled down to the sound of distant thunder. Our hosts advised that we took shelter before the rain started and soon after the short walk to my hut the first spots were falling. Recording equipment was hurriedly set up under the veranda and my hut-mate and I settled down on deck-chairs. After only a very short wait, with skipper frogs calling from the nearby pond, the rain started. Very soon the only sound was of rain and distant thunder and everyone, even the monitor lizard that lived in the thatch of our roof, stayed put until the storm passed.]]></description>

Live at Silo 6, Auckland at the Audio Foundations Now! Here! Festival 12.08.12

A performance in one New Zealands most reverberant spaces, a complex of six disused cement silos on Aucklands waterfront. Harnessing their amazing acoustics, Stanier Black-Five made a series of initial field recordings within the silos, which were then re-introduced into the same space as the source material for this live performance. All the reverb is natural. No effects were used.

Stanier Black-Five is the New Zealand-based sound artist and writer, Jo Burzynska. Her audio work is largely based on the manipulation of her own environmental recordings and found sounds, which she uses to create dense soundscapes that use sources such as the pounding rhythms of trains to the sounds of the earthquakes that have recently shaken her city. She also creates multi-sensory installations that combine sound and taste.

Thanks to the Audio Foundation for hosting the event, David Hornblow &amp; Shaun Collins for the live sound &amp; Malcolm Riddoch for the mastering..]]></description>

bower floor | dawn chorus with rain | canyon wires

music sits above and under the first impression.
when duration allows these things come into focus, increasingly. 
in swifter moments a sense of quietude is possible.
still, finding pace with listening as a lens, moving

recorded september 2012, during time spent following a residency at The Wired Lab, this piece begins with two recordings playing at the same time. One of a bower floor, with contact microphones and geophone (nb. some of these low frequencies will not be audible via computer speakers) alongside a dawn chorus amidst light rain - drops falling centimetres from a conventional stereo microphone. Towards the middle of the piece, a further contact microphone recording enters, revealing one of the most bizarre fence wire sounds i've yet managed to gather. Despite returning to the same stretch of canyon fence several times, this particular effect was only present on one occasion and lasted for around 10 minutes. My best guess is that humidity and the rising temperature combined to create a momentary, unrepeatable and extremely evocative effect on the wires. It is this infinite and unpredictable aspect to listening in situ that continues to fascinate me. Getting closer to and underneath the surface of environments and spaces is a constant revelation, a constant pleasure.

Live Performance on April 21st, 2012 at the YU Contemporary Art Center located in Portland, Oregon USA. This concert was a two hour non-stop performance and this recording only captured an hour and fifteen minutes due to a recording failing. The amplifiers also blew out at the end. The room in which this concert was performed was the size of a city block (68,000 ft/20726 m) and had enormous room acoustics with considerable natural reverberations. Maximum volume was used, for 120 bodies were present to absorb this 120 minute sonic mass.

The resurgence of vinyl in recent years is a phenomenon which has not gone unnoticed; as CD declines sharply, its audio limitations exposed not only by advances in other technologies, but also by the myths propagated at the inception of digital exposed, so artists explore and demand other formats to express their work. Although a business model is still some way off the traditional artist  label  distribution  shop paradigm, it is clear this is being radically overhauled and replaced by online sales platforms set up by the artists themselves.

			<description><![CDATA[Volume five in an ongoing series.
Self-assembled and reversed in February 2012.
Photography: Heitor Alvelos

Why not pay a humble tribute to the golden age of backmasking? Once upon a time, radio DJs would go up in flames accusing pop records of containing satanic messages woven backwards onto the groove. These would then supposedly make their way onto your teenage subconscious, and from its depths command you to do very bad things. 

Echoes of the Altamont and Manson traumas aside, it was all a bit naive when compared to the magnitude of the very shady side of the entertainment industry nowadays, where worthwhile pop music once again becomes demonised: the recent, heavy policy proposals against online piracy, the terrorist-like shutdown of megaupload, the steamroller-like production-line of prime-time karaoke, the pervasive disgust of auto-tuning, the endless parade of cute iGadgets valiantly ignoring the abyss of over-consumption and worldwide economic meltdown.

Hubris, Icarus, Tower of Babel... Some say the future is once again in the local. Let's just forget all those un-local languages, then. Press play, unlearn them all, quickly and painlessly. Bliss.]]></description>

"The Home Recordings is the extension on the recordings that were made in 2008 in Norway. Being there with no instruments and no source but water to create sound, I was very limited. Returning home, the place you love and when you stay too long, you hate, became the source of these recordings. Everyday you hear something that changes your mood, but sometimes they can be very difficult to record. This can be the cause of different, unwelcome sounds, as you think they are. so I started to record the sounds outside my front door from 04hr. in the morning till 07hr.

Mixing everything  at home in some kind of dark way, not opening the sound up... I used an Emulator Emax 1 because of it's simple sampling sound. all other instruments are acousticly recorded."

New Music Marathon in Seattle, WA the entire first movement was rewritten.

			<description><![CDATA[A few years ago, I had the chance to participate in the organization of a scientific seminar about the relationship between canids and humans, the conferences spreading between ecology, ethology, psychology and anthropology ("Entre Chiens Et Loups", Lyon, 2006). Amongst the invited scientists was Dave Mech a wildlife biologist who spent all his life studying wolves in the field, and in particular on Ellesmere Island located in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

We drove together to visit an area in Lozre, the least populated department of France, where some wolves are kept in in semi-captivity, which means that they are living an unusually large enclosure. Those animals were originally rescued from poachers, and the park has a very good reputation for introducing them to the public. There I could observe the wolves in the company of Dave Mech, who provided some invaluable insight into their behaviour.

Last year, I went back again to visit the wolves with Sylvain Macchi who is in charge of the park. I was able to record the songs of the wolves in the middle of the night and the early morning one February during their mating season. The barks are often associated with aggressive behaviours, meanwhile the chantings are a way to reinforce the cohesion of the group and calm down the tensions. The effect of these sounds, listening to wolves chanting in the complete darkness, is an extreme experience. Those arch-shaped tones are amongst the most beautiful things one can hear from the animal kingdom.

Composed in May 2011. Field recordings mostly made in February 2010.

Thanks a lot to Dave Mech for the inspiration and Sylvain Macchi for introducing me to the wolves of Gevaudan.

			<description><![CDATA[Alex Halsted is a fish. Specifically, the Gnathonemus Petersii is an Elephantnose fish native to the Niger River in West and Central Africa.  The fish has very poor eyesight and emits a weak electrical field from electro receptors covering its body.  These receptors allow the fish to send a sonar-like electric pulse similar to the bats use of echolocation.  

On 24 September 2009, David More, a sound artist who creates sound works by harnessing variations from the fishs electric field, and I, executed experiments using the frequencies created by the fish as white noise to record for Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) and additional energy provided by Heidi Harman using Reiki.

The EVPs captured were not only very strong, but they seem to also refer to the fish, to David and also in some cases seem to refer to itself as the fish.  Is it possible that disincarnate entities taping into available frequencies to communicate also pick up personality or other energies that define the identity of the being its taping into?

Included in this adaptation is a previously unreleased composition created using the frequencies of the fish as well as the EVPs captured and separately, the EVPs captured during those trials.

Whatever the physics of the phenomena are from those experiments, one thing we are sure of: Alex Halsted is a fish.

Zound Delta was made at a residency with the European Sound Delta Project in 2009. The sounds were recorded from the mouth of the Danube River at the Black Sea, - to about 200km upstream, at Russe Bulgaria. In Russe, there was a festival, and the finished piece was played. There were boats (Belgian barges outfitted as living boats) starting at the mouth of the Danube and the Rhine Rivers, with changing residents, for several months.

Bells and Timps was made using church bells in Gent Belgium, recorded by Godfried Willem Raes of Logos Foundation, in 1986. I modified the time by stretching vastly, and some changes in pitch as well.

BuchBel was recorded during an overnight train ride from Bucharest to Belgrade. All sounds are from the train, with many layerings. The train trip was immediately after the festival in Russe, Bulgaria, in 2009.

			<description><![CDATA[Nacre was composed for the experimental music festival 'Skanu mezs' in Riga, Latvia. The premiere of Nacre was held there on 23rd May 2009 in St. Saviour's Anglican Church. [With thanks to Viestarts Gailitis.]

For a church organ and light organ

Composed by Hildur Gunadttir
Performed by Charles Matthews and Hildur Gunadttir
Installation by Eln Hansdttir and Hildur Gunadttir
Light organ programmed by Derek Holzer

Nacre is dedicated to Hildur's grandmother Margrt Gunadttir, who celebrated her 80th birthday in July 2009.

The title refers to her name, since both the noun 'Nacre' and the name 'Margrt' mean 'Mother of Pearl'.

Nacre is a written for 2 types of organs; a church organ and a light organ, therefore the score is twofold.

1. Church Organ/DNA:

Nacre's score is in the shape of a 360 degree helix of a double strand DNA. This form was chosen as a connection to Margrt's passionate work as a virologist.  DNA forms the basis of inheritance in all organisms, except viruses, although DNA can be found in a few viruses such as herpes. DNA also connects grandmother and granddaughter, whereas it holds genetic information to be passed on from one generation to the next.

2. Light Organ/Newton:

The basis of the light organ is Newton's color circle. He was the first person to connect colour to wavelengths of light and made the colour circle based on that theory. His circle consists of 7 colours and he assigned musical notes to each colour. Newton's scale starts with red, to which he assigned the note D. The scale continues as a diatonic scale from D (also known as the Dorian mode); E=orange, F=yellow etc.

A light system was made specially for Nacre, which reads the frequencies being played on the church organ and triggers coloured lights for each note in Newton's color circle. When the note D is played on the organ, for example, a red light shines in the light organ.

The light organ hangs above the audience. 70 LED lights are arranged in mirror-origami modules that are held up by giant balloons. The floating lights are therefore multiplied and create a slight spatial distortion.

Score/Performance:

The 21 angstrm width of the DNA is divided into 3 sets of Newton's 7 colour circle. Each set of colours are played on different manuals of the organ; one set is played on the pedals, another set is played on the 1st manual and the third set is played on the 2nd manual.

The 34 angstrm length of the DNA serves as a timeline for Nacre.

The form of the DNA determines when each note should be played. When the DNA rises or falls to a note in Nacre's score, it should be played until the DNA rises or falls on the same note, then the note is released. All the notes are indicated in the score with corresponding colours lighting up in the color organ. The result of this is a giant chord, where the overtones engage in a war as to which note shines the brightest in the light organ.

Newton's colour circle is also spread horizontally over the length of the DNA, starting at red with low frequencies and working its way up the frequency scale up to purple.

The "musical colours" of the chord are controlled by the 2nd performer next to the organist, who pulls or pushes the church organ stops in and out, creating an overtone resonance beat according to the horizontal colour circle. Starting with the lower stops and slower beat, working its way up to the higher stops and faster beat.]]></description>

"Book of Hours" was recorded in the remarkable baroque central dome of the National Pantheon in Lisbon.

The musicians (and the audience) were 40 meters above ground level on a narrow circular balcony looking out over the abyss.  The main sound source was a crystal bowl, played by Joo Silva, which was struck and resonated with a stick.  Paulo Raposo processed these sounds and diffused them throughout the space via 6 channels, 4 of which were small self-powered speakers, arranged symetrically around the circumference of the dome.  Carlos Santos also moved throughout the space and the audience with a small glass and a Tibetan bell.

The sonic interactions in "Book of Hours" aimed to reveal the inherently active qualities of the space, itself a performer in this acoustic dialog.]]></description>

Carlos Santos also moved throughout the space and the audience with a small glass and a Tibetan bell.

The sonic interactions in &quot;Book of Hours&quot; aimed to reveal the inherently active qualities of the space, itself a performer in this acoustic dialog.</itunes:summary>

			<description><![CDATA[How to catch a truffle

Ancient Greeks, as much in the dark as anyone else when it came to where the white truffle is to be found, shrugged and announced that the tuber magnatum occurred wherever lightning struck the ground. Cobblers, of course, but thats the excuse for beginning this piece with a burgeoning thunder storm  in September 2008, on the Barbialla Nuova estate near San Miniato, Tuscany. This is an area famed for its white truffles.

Then a truffle hunt, with Imperio, Bobbi and Sabali. Bobbi is a dog, a breed called Lagotto. Imperio is the hunter. Sabali translates Imperio now and again, but most of the time he is chatting to the dog, saying Find!, Is it or isnt it? He gets very angry with the cat (Go home!) who, feeling sociable, joined us on this three-hour walk.

A truffle is found and Bobbi, having pulled up a 12-inches of earth, doesn't want to surrender it. At least with a dog you can yank him away by the scruff of the neck, and Bobbi was occasionally seen flying over Imperios shoulder. Not so easy with pigs, who used to be employed as truffle hunters  but enough of an excuse to include the sounds of Silvio here, the biggest of the farm's Cinta Senese breed.

There the tenuous links end, unless anyone knows of a connection between truffles and the crickets, tawny owls and mystery birds that chattered deep in to the night.

			<description><![CDATA[A submarine-like structure sits on a traffic island in the middle of Akerman Road, London SW9. It was built in the 1970s above the large underground boiler room that provides heat for the Myatts Field estates, which lie on either side of the road. The boilers still heat more than 300 buildings to the south of the road, but their unreliability caused the north-side estate to switch to another heating source in the early 1990s. The heating system was sited underground because to do so was considered best practice at this stage of the Cold War, when a nuclear conflict sometimes seemed a distinct possibility. At the time the estates were built, both the US and the USSR maintained large fleets of weapon-bearing submarines: ocean-going doubles of the Akerman Road structure. In spring 2008 I made some recordings of the machinery in the boiler room. These have been organised into a composition. I have filtered some of the sounds but no digital processing has been used.

Headphones are recommended. Recorded 24/96, with binaural stereo mic.

"Sapientum super acquis" is the title attribuited to the "Magistrato alle acque" of the Serenissima Venetian Republic, an organ istituited on 1501 by the "Council of ten", that had the job of keeping safe the delicate natural/artificial balance of the lagoon, and looking after the "health" of the water.

Today the water is mostly polluted because of Porto Marghera, one of the biggest industrial areas in the whole Europe. ]]></description>

As a starting point, electronic sounds were created using a malfunctioning Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 synth, recorded in 5 improvised passes of 25 minutes each - 5x5=25. The title also reflects this, silver being the material that denotes a 25th anniversary. Field recordings were made in Thailand and New Zealand over December 2006 and incorporated into the sonic jamboree - the piercing, feedback like tone at the start is the actual sound of cicadas in the Thai sub-tropical rainforest, untreated, the sound they produce as individuals synchronizing every 60/90 seconds to produce almost a pure sine wave. Further on is the dawn chorus in Wellington, New Zealand with the distinctive, clacking call of a bird called a Tui sounding out. Close to the end of the piece is the singing of a young Thai lad, sat around the neck of an elephant as we both rode into the rainforest, 'home' never too far away for me as he was wearing a t-shirt on the back of which was printed the front page of a US newspaper from 1979 announcing the death of Sid Vicious!

"The sounds I here perform with were recorded in two ways: with an acoustic microphone and with an accelerometer. For the acoustic recordings I used a Sanken CSS-5 which I held very closely to the tiny bubbling surface. The accelerometer was inserted approximately 4 cm into the earth and picked up a denser timbre than the acoustic microphone. As opposed to the Eldfjall CD release (where I chose to let the sounds stand by themselves), I here mixed the different sounds with each other to create a more organic sound and a narrative. I began the concert with creaking ice from different lakes in Iceland. These were also recorded with accelerometers. None of the sounds have been processed."]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Devolution/Evolution: Stephen O'Malley interviews Dylan Carlson: "Last August I was invited by the american metal magazine, Decibel, to interview Dylan Carlson for a regular feature they call "Under the Influence". The idea of the feature is basically musicians interviewing their main inspirators from the prior time, or something. Although this could be a bit silly and demeaning, Dylan and I have become friendly over the past few years and we both thought it would be a fun opportunity to talk shop and have this published! I can't count the number of times we have been nerding out over tube talk, guitars etc... which is almost the result of this piece. The editor of this said mag agreed to handle the transcription, so I added some initially Ambarchi-inspired bass waves to the recording in order to increase the pressure and atmosphere for the sorry intern who inherited the work. The feature ran with a ridiculous editorial introduction recently, but I think the recording itself turned into a gem of interest. The most memorable part of the conversation included categorization of guitar models by religious persuasion, and speech metal as an athletic event. This marked the second time I interviewed Dylan formally, the first time being in 1993 for a fanzine I had at the time (which remains unpublished, I have the tape somewhere)."]]></description>

			<itunes:summary>Devolution/Evolution: Stephen O&apos;Malley interviews Dylan Carlson: &quot;Last August I was invited by the american metal magazine, Decibel, to interview Dylan Carlson for a regular feature they call &quot;Under the Influence&quot;. The idea of the feature is basically musicians interviewing their main inspirators from the prior time, or something. Although this could be a bit silly and demeaning, Dylan and I have become friendly over the past few years and we both thought it would be a fun opportunity to talk shop and have this published! I can&apos;t count the number of times we have been nerding out over tube talk, guitars etc... which is almost the result of this piece. The editor of this said mag agreed to handle the transcription, so I added some initially Ambarchi-inspired bass waves to the recording in order to increase the pressure and atmosphere for the sorry intern who inherited the work. The feature ran with a ridiculous editorial introduction recently, but I think the recording itself turned into a gem of interest. The most memorable part of the conversation included categorization of guitar models by religious persuasion, and speech metal as an athletic event. This marked the second time I interviewed Dylan formally, the first time being in 1993 for a fanzine I had at the time (which remains unpublished, I have the tape somewhere).&quot;</itunes:summary>

			<description><![CDATA[Peter Rehberg - Paris Qui Dort - Recorded live at Centre Pompidou, Paris 11.09.2004:

"In June 2004 I was asked by Cinemix to perform a live score to the silent movie 'Paris Qui Dort' (directed by Ren Clair in 1923) at the Centre Pompidou in Paris on September 11th of that year. 'Paris Qui Dort' ('Paris Asleep', or as the English version of the film is known: 'The Invisible Ray') was not only Ren Clair's first film but the first film to investigate the theme of the 'deserted city'. The night watchman on the Eiffel Tower comes off his shift to find people all over Paris frozen in motion. Eventually he meets a group of unfrozen people who arrived that morning on a plane. The group enjoys the luxury of the city, dining in restaurants and taking jewelry as they want, however boredom soon sets in and the men fight over the woman. Eventually they receive a radio message directing them to come to a particular address. There a scientist tells them how he invented a ray that has frozen the whole city. They were unaffected because the Eiffel Tower and plane were out of the rays range.

And so on.....

This is the recording of that live score."]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Toshiya Tsunoda - Appearance of physical vibration:

These recordings are studies of the sonic effects of physical vibration

Track 1 - high frequency on a plate glass - 05:46
"Seven piezo ceramic discs are connected with an sine wave generator - and the discs are on a plate glass. Same frequency is output to the piezo discs The frequency shifts slowly and continuously from 9000hz to 20000hz. Due to this, you can listen various sounds made by high-speed cyclic contact between piezo disc and a plate glass, like a ball dribbles. This recording is a private live performance at my room."
Track 2 - top of amplitude - 08:25
"I detected the top and bottom of the amplitude from a certain audio signal by a precious gate device. L channel is top (plus level), R channel is bottom (minus level)."
Track 3 - on electromagnetic siren - 05:26
"Output an audio signal to the coil of an 100hz electromagnetic siren.
The electromagnetic siren vibrates, so you can listen to the amplitude changes according to an audio signal on R channel. L channel, connected by an electrical wire to small metal reeds on the siren which acts like a switch to transmit any vibration from the coil. You can listen intermittently to any change in the vibration. In this work, there are two ways of description; the R channel is continual or linear, the L channel is intermit or dotted."

["The audio signals of tracks 2 and 3 are field recordings source material - environmental sounds from the suburbs. Track 2 was recorded by me, in Fukada-dai, Yokosuka City, Japan, c. 1997. Track 3 was recorded by Steve Roden somewhere in California. Track 3 was made for Steve Roden's installation project several years before which was held in a certain museum of California. 

This material has not been released on any recording media."]]></description>
